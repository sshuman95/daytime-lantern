  <h1>About Daytime Lantern</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Daytime Lantern, it's as pointless as it sounds!</p>
  <p>
    The Daytime Lantern, as the name suggests, is an app that exists for no
    other reason than to serve as a personal playground. It's a beacon in broad
    daylight, whimsical and perhaps a bit redundant, much like a real lantern
    would be during the day. But that's where the charm lies.

  <p>
    This is where I tinker with fresh ideas, explore new features, and
    continuously hone my skills. As you navigate through, you'll find various
    components that stand testament to my evolving learning curve.

  <p>
    If you're a recruiter or interviewer, feel free to explore. The Daytime
    Lantern should give you a glimpse into my journey of growth and my
    commitment to coding - even if it's shrouded in a veil of whimsy.

  <p>Thank you for stopping by. Enjoy exploring the Daytime Lantern!</p>
